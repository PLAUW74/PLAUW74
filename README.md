## 🧠 About Me

🎮 CS Student in Interactive Media & Game Development | Background in Animation and Digital Media

From pixels to code, I love blending art and technology to create interactive experiences that captivate and inspire.
With 3 years in design and media and over 3 years in tech, I bring both artistic creativity and technical precision to every project I take on.

I enjoy working across both sides of development. On the technical side, I develop interactive systems using C++, Unity, and Unreal Engine. On the creative side, I have experience contributing to animated films and game projects using Maya and Photoshop.

I am always excited to collaborate, learn, and build something meaningful, especially projects that merge technology, storytelling, and design.
